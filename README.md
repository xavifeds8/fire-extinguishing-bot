## Fire Extinguishing robot
We aim to design a robot capable of detecting and suppressing fires. This robot model works in such a way that it tries to detect fire and extinguishes the fire. The robot model consists of an ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04 and IR based thermal sensor. Based on the intensity reading of the thermal sensor the fire bot sets its goal position and the ultrasonic module helps in obstacle avoidance. The bot is equipped with the fire extinguishing system which consists of a water pump. After the fire is being extinguished the bot looks for any other presence of fire.
